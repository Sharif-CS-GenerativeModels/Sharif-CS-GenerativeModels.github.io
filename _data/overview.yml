title: Course description
content: "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the cutting-edge techniques behind data generation modeling in artificial intelligence. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how generative models can learn complex data distributions and produce novel outputs, such as realistic images, texts, and sounds. To this end, the probabilistic foundations behind both of shallow and deep generative models are introduced. The course equips participants with the theoretical foundations and practical skills necessary to excel in both academic research and industry applications."
